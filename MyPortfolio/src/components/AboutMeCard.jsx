            For over a decade, I worked in customer service and management‚Äîserving, bartending, and eventually stepping into both bar and floor manager roles. The real turning point came when I became the bar manager at <em>The Shamrock</em>. Wanting to help the business grow, I took the initiative to build its online presence‚Äîlaunching social media accounts and even <strong>designing a website</strong>.

            What started as a creative side project quickly <em>lit a fire in me</em>. I realized I loved the process‚Äî<strong>problem solving</strong>, <strong>designing</strong>, and <em>bringing something to life online</em>.

            From there, I found myself increasingly involved in the technical side of restaurant operations, especially when it came to <strong>implementing and maintaining POS systems</strong>. I loved seeing how <em>small changes in the interface or workflow could make a huge impact</em> on team efficiency and guest satisfaction.

            That curiosity‚Äîand a desire to create more <strong>thoughtful</strong>, <strong>user-friendly tools</strong>‚Äîled me to discover <em>LaunchCode</em>. Through the program, I gained hands-on experience with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong> while working on projects that felt meaningful.

            My favorite moment? Working on my capstone project, where I got to build both the <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>backend</strong>. It was <strong>designing my project with React</strong>, where I really <em>fell in love with frontend development</em> and the <em>power of a well-designed UI</em>. At the same time, diving into the <strong>backend</strong> and <strong>database</strong> really deepened my appreciation for how all the pieces come together to create seamless, <strong>full-stack applications</strong>.

          <Typography >
            Now, I'm excited to <strong>continue learning and growing as a developer</strong>. My goal is to build applications that are not only functional, but <strong>intuitive</strong>, <strong>engaging</strong>, and <em>built with real people in mind</em>.
