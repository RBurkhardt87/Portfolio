        <h3>What is My Begonia Baby?</h3>
        <p>This app started as a personal and professional project—something I began building as a parent and International Board Certified Lactation Consultant. The goal is to help parents track their baby's care in a way that actually supports real-world needs, and could even be useful when working with healthcare professionals like pediatricians or lactation consultants.</p>

        <h3>Why I Built It?</h3>
        <p>New parents already have so much to juggle. I wanted to build something that not only helps with tracking day-to-day baby care but could also support healthcare decisions and offer peace of mind. As a lactation consultant, I’ve seen how useful detailed tracking can be—and how frustrating most apps can feel. This app is my way of creating something better, from the ground up.</p>
