        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <br/>
        <div>
          <p>For over a decade, I worked in customer service and management‚Äîserving, bartending, and eventually stepping into both bar and floor manager roles. The real turning point came when I became the bar manager at The Shamrock. Wanting to help the business grow, I took the initiative to build its online presence‚Äîlaunching social media accounts and even designing a website. What started as a creative side project quickly lit a fire in me. I realized I loved the process‚Äîproblem solving, designing, and bringing something to life online.</p><br />

          <p>From there, I found myself increasingly involved in the technical side of restaurant operations, especially when it came to implementing and maintaining POS systems. I loved seeing how small changes in the interface or workflow could make a huge impact on team efficiency and guest satisfaction.</p><br />

          <p>That curiosity‚Äîand a desire to create more thoughtful, user-friendly tools‚Äîled me to discover LaunchCode. Through the program, I gained hands-on experience with JavaScript, React, Java, Spring Boot, and SQL while working on projects that felt meaningful. My favorite moment? Designing my capstone project with React, where I really fell in love with frontend development and the power of a well-designed UI.</p><br />

          <p>Now, I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer. My goal is to build applications that are not only functional, but intuitive, engaging, and built with real people in mind.</p><br />

          <p>Whether it's helping streamline everyday tasks, crafting better tools for businesses, or just bringing a little joy through design‚ÄîI'm here for it. üç∏ ‚û°Ô∏è üíª</p><br />
